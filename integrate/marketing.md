## About

The Osmosis Ministry of Marketing was formed to help market Osmosis. Don't hestitate to reach out to [osmosismarketing@osmosisdao.team](osmosismarketing@osmosisdao.team). There exist many opportunites to better market a project and its assets, and feel free to suggest new marketing ideas that aren't listed.


## Marketing Opportunities

### Co-sponsored Twitter Competition

An art competition, such as a Meme creation competition run on Twitter is a great way to get people excited about a project and to help spread awareness by requiring tagging, sharing, and/or retweeting as part of the qualification requirements. Historically, these have been meme-competitions (who can make the funniest memes?), but it could also be serious art, or, really, anything else.

Osmosis Ministry of Marketing Sponsorship Amounts:
- 1st place: 69 OSMO
- 2nd place: 20 OSMO
- 3rd place: 4 OSMO

Sponsoring Project Amounts:
- Can be virtually any amount, but should at least be worth the OMM Sponsorship amounts.
- Should have an amount for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place winners

### Sponsored Graphics

The Osmosis Ministry of Marketing can commission graphics to promote newly listed assets, specific pools, external incentives on specific pools, and significant governance proposals. These will be shared on many platforms to maximaize visibility (Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Instragram, Facebook, Medium, etc.).

We let our talented artists run with their ideas on how best to produce an attractive graphic. If a project would like to collaborate on the artisitc design aspects or upgrade the graphic to a short video clip, it will incur an extra fee which can be priced upon discussion.

Fee 25 OSMO
