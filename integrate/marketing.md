## Marketing Opportunities

### Co-sponsored Twitter Competition

An art competition, such as a Meme creation competition run on Twitter is a great way to get people excited about a project and to help spread awareness by requiring tagging, sharing, and/or retweeting as part of the qualification requirements. Historically, these have been meme-compoetitions (who can make the funniest memes?), but it could also be serious art, or, really, anything else.
